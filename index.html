  <h3>Readings</h3>

  <h4><a href="https://www.are.na/blog/the-internet's-back-to-the-land-movement" target="_blank">The Internet's Back to the Land Movement</a></h4>

  <h3>Questions</h3>

  <p>The two articles both articulate an ethical problem related to their topic (industry-standard design tools & the current scale and state of the internet). Define what you consider to be the authors positions in relation to these two topics and how they overlap. Do they suggest solutions? If so, how do those solutions relate to the other article?</p>

  <p>Aside from the mastery of certain digital tools and programs, what skills do you see as integral to your graphic design practice?</p>

  <h3>Response</h3>

  <p>In the first article, the author talks about how graphic design has become very reliant on Apple and Adobe. In the second article, the author talks about how the Internet is having a greater impact on the world than we think. Both authors talk about solutions to these problems. The first article talks about paper.js, and how the creation of tools like these can allow designers to step away from companies like Apple and Adobe and still be able to create. In the second article, the author also sides with finding a solution to the problem. At the end of the article, the author talks about how Low-Tech could be a solution to the impact of the internet on the world by only serving smaller groups or communities. I think that both articles relate to each other because the second article talks about WELL, and how it could have also been a small solution to large corporations having too much control just like Apple and Adobe have over the graphic design world. I think that being creative is an integral skill in graphic design because if you had no tools or programs you could still be able to think and create something.</p>

  <h2 id="Reading2">Reading 2: Olia Lialina — Turing Complete User & Laurel Schwulst — My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge</h2>

  <h3>Readings</h3>

  <h4><a href="http://contemporary-home-computing.org/turing-complete-user/" target="_blank">Turing Complete User</a></h4>
  
  <h4><a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/essays/laurel-schwulst-my-website-is-a-shifting-house-next-to-a-river-of-knowledge-what-could-yours-be/" target="_blank">Laura Schwulst</a></h4>

  <h3>Questions</h3>

  <p>What do you think of Lialina’s definition of the universal user? Do you think it is a useful category for understanding Schwulst’s argument advocating for individual websites over platforms? Explain why and provide at least 1 example. </p>

  <p>What kind of computer user are you? Draw on concepts from Lialina’s text, and integrate a quotation in your answer. Make use of metaphor, if you can, to describe your experience online (à la Schwulst).</p>

  <h3>Response</h3>

  <p>1.I think that Lialina's definition of the universal user makes sense. She talks about a universal user being someone who doesn't need to rely on specific apps or platforms to do what those platforms offer. She uses an example that a universal user is able to tweet without using Twitter by posting something on a personal website. I think that this does a good job at helping to explain what a universal user is because it shows that someone doesn't need to rely on Twitter to send out a comment for other people to read, and although it is not an actual tweet it still functions the same way as a tweet would. "You can decide not to use Twitter at all and instead inform the world about your breakfast through your own website. You can use Live Journal as if it is Twitter." In Schwulst's article, she advocates that having individual websites that are controlled by a single person or a small group of people rather than large corporations like Twitter or Facebook would be beneficial to the internet because it would allow for more freedom with what people can do on the web. I think that Lialina's definition is useful for understanding Schwulst's argument Lialina defines a universal user as someone who would advocate for the same argument as Schwulst.</p>

  <p>2.I think that I would be closest to a naive user. The article describes a naive user as someone who doesn't know about computers and uses systems that are clear and simple. “Person who doesn’t know about computers but is going to use the system. Naive user systems are those set up to make things easy and clear for such people. I wouldn't say that I am completely a naive user because I do know a little bit about computers but the software and hardware of computers isn't something that interests me that much.</p>

  <h4><a href="https://www.typotheque.com/articles/the_importance_of_play" target="_blank">The Importance of Play</a></h4>

  <h3>Question</h3>

  <p>A key part to generative design and code is pattern and routine. Akin to a chess player, marking each move down, and keeping a trace of your decisions can prove useful for your own process and future making. As a designer, to know that there might be a variety of possibilities to a given situation, can aid our ways of observing by using tools in novel ways. In one series of work, Van Rossum looks to fundamentals of waveforms as a departure point and reference point for connecting an interface to affecting the parameters of a letterform. If the letters explode, so too would the speakers. Find 1 unique example of a pattern in nature, that appears to be programmatic. Post a visual of this pattern and describe how it is programmatic in nature. </p>

  <img src="snowflake.jpg" width="500" height="333">

  <p>The image that I chose is a snowflake. From what I understand, snowflakes are formed when a water molecule freezes onto a small piece of dust in the sky. As it falls through the sky it will collect more water molecules which is what creates the arms. Different temperatures and atmospheric pressure are what causes each snowflake to be a different pattern. So, a snowflake creates its symmetry as it is falling through the air, it is always symmetrical because each water molecule that is attached to the first molecule to start falling is under the same conditions so each arm will be created symmetrically. I think this is a really good example of a programmatic patterns in nature because they way that snowflakes form are quite simple, but each small change as it is falling, wether it is the temperature, pressure, how fast or slow it is falling, and so on, is able to make each snowflake different from the ones around it. It sort of reminded me of p5.js because of how you can plug in a bunch of numbers into a shape, but when you change one number it is able to change the entire design.</p>

  <h2 id="Reading4">Reading 4: In Free Fall, Hito Steyerl</h2>

  <h3>Reading</h3>

  <h4><a href="https://www.e-flux.com/journal/24/67860/in-free-fall-a-thought-experiment-on-vertical-perspective/" target="_blank">Hito Steyerl</a></h4>

  <h3>Question</h3>

  <p>A major theme that runs throughout Steyerl’s essay is that of surveillance. In your own words, define surveillance and discuss how the notion of a “vertical” or aerial perspective lends itself to a culture of surveillance according to Steyerl’s thought experiment.</p>

  <h3>Response</h3>

  <p>I think that surveillance could be defined as watching over or observing someone or something to gather information. I don't think that surveillance has to be from a vertical perspective because Steyerl talks about how the vertical perspective established a "new visual normality" from the linear perspective. She mentions in her essay all the different kinds of aerial surveillance, for example, google maps, satellites, and drones. I think that why the vertical perspective is closely related to surveillance is because as all of these new technologies were developed, it became much easier to conduct surveillance because with the new technologies we were able to see the earth or specific places from different angles. I also think that this was good for not only for militaries but also for the main civilization that uses apps like google maps or land surveying and needs overhead views in fields like topology. She talks about how with drones militaries are able to remotely fly around drones from a safe location to gather information, which before, they would have needed a pilot but now can have someone who doesn't;t need to go through pilot training and can safely carry out more or less the same job.</p>
